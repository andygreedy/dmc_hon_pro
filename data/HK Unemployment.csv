Note(s):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figures in this table are the latest data released on 22 February 2023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Hong Kong, the first released figures on GDP by expenditure component in respect of a period are called ""advance estimates"". When more data become available, the figures will be revised. All those figures published subsequently, after the advance estimates, are called ""revised figures"". These ""revised figures"" are still subject to further regular revision later on when more data are incorporated. This routine revision is in accordance with the international practice to compile and release GDP figures at the earliest possible time by using only partial data. In general, the figures are finalised when finalised data from all regular sources are incorporated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The rate of change of GDP in real terms for 2023 is forecast to be 3.5% to 5.5%. For more information on the forecast of GDP, please visit the website of the Office of the Government Economist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Users should note that the figures of exports and imports of goods in this table are different from those published in external merchandise trade statistics which are not compiled based on the change of ownership principle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
